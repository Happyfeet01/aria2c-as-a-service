**Libraries and tools**

- [Aria2JsonRpc](http://xyne.archlinux.ca/projects/python3-aria2jsonrpc/) is a Python 3 module that provides a wrapper class around Aria2's RPC interface. It can be used to build applications that use Aria2 for downloading data.
- This [directory](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t/aria2/tree/master/doc/xmlrpc) contains sample scripts to interact with aria2 via XML-RPC. For more information, see http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/aria2/wiki/XmlrpcInterface
- [Aria2 Tools](https://github.com/nmbooker/aria2-tools) Some tools and instructions to help supplement aria2 when used as a download server.


**Web UI**
